# `.terraform.lock.hcl` - Terraform Dependency Lock File

## **What is `.terraform.lock.hcl`?**
The `.terraform.lock.hcl` file is a **dependency lock file** used by **Terraform** to ensure consistent provider versions across different runs.

## **Purpose of `.terraform.lock.hcl`**
- Records the exact versions of Terraform providers used in your project.
- Ensures **reproducible builds** by preventing unexpected upgrades.
- Helps with **team collaboration** by maintaining the same versions across environments.

## **When is it Created?**
- It is generated automatically when you run `terraform init`.
- Terraform downloads and locks provider versions in this file.

## **Example Content**
```hcl
provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws" {
  version     = "4.0.0"
  hashes      = [
    "h1:abcd1234...",
    "zh:abcd5678..."
  ]
}
```
- The **provider block** specifies the exact version.
- The **hashes** verify the integrity of the provider.

## **Should You Commit `.terraform.lock.hcl` to Git?**
✅ **Yes**, in most cases:
- Ensures team members use the same provider versions.
- Prevents unexpected breaking changes in CI/CD pipelines.

❌ **No**, if:
- You want Terraform to always fetch the latest compatible versions.

## **How to Update the Lock File?**
- Run `terraform init -upgrade` to refresh it with newer provider versions.

## **Best Practices**
- Always commit the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file for better consistency.
- Use `terraform init -upgrade` cautiously to avoid breaking changes.
- Regularly review locked versions to ensure security and stability.
